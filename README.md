## Fun Fact

I am an advide hiker! My wife and I are currently 29/48 on the NH 4000 footers list. I've also backpacked through Iceland in November of 2023 for my 24th birthday! Along with risking my life climbing the cliffs of Acadia National Park. I can't wait to explore the rest of our beautiful parks!
